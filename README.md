In order for macchina to be able to find your themes, you need to place them in:

- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/macchina/themes on Linux and the BSDs.
- $HOME/Library/Application Support/macchina/themes on macOS.
- {FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}/macchina/themes on Windows.

To start using your theme:

- Run macchina --list-themes to verify that macchina has listed your theme.
- Add that same name you see in your terminal to the theme option in macchina.toml
- You're good to go! macchina will start using your theme.

Note: Install https://www.nerdfonts.com/ for your terminal
